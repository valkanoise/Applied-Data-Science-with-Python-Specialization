# A pivot table is a way of summarizing data in a DataFrame for a particular purpose. It makes heavy use of
# the aggregation function. A pivot table is itself a DataFrame, where the rows represent one variable that
# you're interested in, the columns another, and the cell's some aggregate value. A pivot table also tends to
# includes marginal values as well, which are the sums for each column and row. This allows you to be able to
# see the relationship between two variables at just a glance.

# Lets take a look at pivot tables in pandas
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


# In[3]:


# Here we have the Times Higher Education World University Ranking dataset, which is one of the most
# influential university measures. Let's import the dataset and see what it looks like
df = pd.read_csv('datasets/cwurData.csv')
df.head()


# In[5]:


# Here we can see each institution's rank, country, quality of education, other metrics, and overall score.
# Let's say we want to create a new column called Rank_Level, where institutions with world ranking 1-100 are
# categorized as first tier and those with world ranking 101 - 200 are second tier, ranking 201 - 300 are
# third tier, after 301 is other top universities.

# Now, you actually already have enough knowledge to do this, so why don't you pause the video and give it a
# try?

# Here's my solution, I'm going to create a function called create_category which will operate on the first
# column in the dataframe, world_rank
def create_category(ranking):
    # Since the rank is just an integer, I'll just do a bunch of if/elif statements
    if (ranking >= 1) & (ranking <= 100):
        return "First Tier Top Unversity"
    elif (ranking >= 101) & (ranking <= 200):
        return "Second Tier Top Unversity"
    elif (ranking >= 201) & (ranking <= 300):
        return "Third Tier Top Unversity"
    return "Other Top Unversity"

# Now we can apply this to a single column of data to create a new series
# poner la funci칩n lambda ac치 es redundande pero viene bien entenderla
df['Rank_Level'] = df['world_rank'].apply(lambda x: create_category(x)) 

# otra forma de hacer lo mismo
df['Rank_Level'] = df['world_rank'].apply(create_category)
# And lets look at the result
df.head()


# In[20]:


# Vemos que score es una columna

df.columns


# In[6]:


# A pivot table allows us to pivot out one of these columns a new column headers and compare it against
# another column as row indices. Let's say we want to compare rank level versus country of the universities
# and we want to compare in terms of overall score

# To do this, we tell Pandas we want the values to be Score, and index to be the country and the columns to be
# the rank levels. Then we specify that the aggregation function, and here we'll use the NumPy mean to get the
# average rating for universities in that country

df.pivot_table(values='score', index='country', columns='Rank_Level', aggfunc=[np.mean]).head()


# In[12]:


df[df['country']=='Argentina']


# In[5]:


# We can see a  hierarchical dataframe where the index, or rows, are by country and the columns have two
# levels, the top level indicating that the mean value is being used and the second level being our ranks. In
# this example we only have one variable, the mean, that we are looking at, so we don't really need a
# heirarchical index.

# We notice that there are some NaN values, for example, the first row, Argentia. The NaN values indicate that
# Argentia has only observations in the "Other Top Unversities" category


# In[13]:


# Now, pivot tables aren't limited to one function that you might want to apply. You can pass a named
# parameter, aggfunc, which is a list of the different functions to apply, and pandas will provide you with
# the result using hierarchical column names.  Let's try that same query, but pass in the max() function too

df.pivot_table(values='score', index='country', columns='Rank_Level', aggfunc=[np.mean, np.max]).head()


# In[7]:


# So now we see we have both the mean and the max. As mentioned earlier, we can also summarize the values
# within a given top level column. For instance, if we want to see an overall average for the country for the
# mean and we want to see the max of the max, we can indicate that we want pandas to provide marginal values
df.pivot_table(values='score', index='country', columns='Rank_Level', aggfunc=[np.mean, np.max], 
               margins=True).head()


# In[14]:


# A pivot table is just a multi-level dataframe, and we can access series or cells in the dataframe in a similar way 
# as we do so for a regular dataframe. 

# Let's create a new dataframe from our previous example
new_df=df.pivot_table(values='score', index='country', columns='Rank_Level', aggfunc=[np.mean, np.max], 
               margins=True)
# Now let's look at the index
print(new_df.index)
# And let's look at the columns
print(new_df.columns)


# In[16]:


# We can see the columns are hierarchical. The top level column indices have two categories: mean and max, and
# the lower level column indices have four categories, which are the four rank levels. How would we query this
# if we want to get the average scores of First Tier Top Unversity levels in each country? We would just need
# to make two dataframe projections, the first for the mean, then the second for the top tier
new_df['mean']['First Tier Top Unversity'].head()


# In[10]:


# We can see that the output is a series object which we can confirm by printing the type. Remember that when
# you project a single column of values out of a DataFrame you get a series.
type(new_df['mean']['First Tier Top Unversity'])


# In[28]:


# What if we want to find the country that has the maximum average score on First Tier Top University level?
# We can use the idxmax() function.
new_df['mean']['First Tier Top Unversity'].idxmax()


# In[12]:


# Now, the idxmax() function isn't special for pivot tables, it's a built in function to the Series object.
# We don't have time to go over all pandas functions and attributes, and I want to encourage you to explore
# the API to learn more deeply what is available to you.


# In[37]:


# If you want to achieve a different shape of your pivot table, you can do so with the stack and unstack
# functions. Stacking is pivoting the lowermost column index to become the innermost row index. Unstacking is
# the inverse of stacking, pivoting the innermost row index to become the lowermost column index. An example
# will help make this clear

# Let's look at our pivot table first to refresh what it looks like
new_df.head()


# In[38]:


# Con .stack() las columnas de nivel m치s bajas, o sea, aquellas incluidas en Rank_Level pasar a ser filas.
# Entonces quedan como columnas las columnas de primer nivel jer치rquico: mean y amax


# Now let's try stacking, this should move the lowermost column, so the tiers of the university rankings, to
# the inner most row
new_df=new_df.stack()
new_df.head()


# In[ ]:





# In[41]:


# In the original pivot table, rank levels are the lowermost column, after stacking, rank levels become the
# innermost index, appearing to the right after country


# Si hacemos unstack() vuelve a su forma original
# Now let's try unstacking
new_df.unstack().head()


# In[44]:


# That seems to restore our dataframe to its original shape. What do you think would happen if we unstacked twice in a row?
new_df.unstack().unstack().head()


# In[17]:


# We actually end up unstacking all the way to just a single column, so a series object is returned. This
# column is just a "value", the meaning of which is denoted by the heirarachical index of operation, rank, and
# country.


# So that's pivot tables. This has been a pretty short description, but they're incredibly useful when dealing
# with numeric data, especially if you're trying to summarize the data in some form. You'll regularly be
# creating new pivot tables on slices of data, whether you're exploring the data yourself or preparing data
# for others to report on. And of course, you can pass any function you want to the aggregate function,
# including those that you define yourself.
